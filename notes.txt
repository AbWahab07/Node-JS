1- Vid REPL
REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print and Loop.

Operations
+, -, /, *, ==, >, <

.help command
.break or ctrl+c

2- Vid Lunch Var
lunch = 'pizza'
single and double quotes can be used
lunch = '12 inch pizza'
sizeOfParty = 4
totalCost = 14.99
averageCost = totalCost / sizeOfParty

use tab to autofill the variable name
String concatenation
message = 'Your Lunch of ' + lunch + ' for ' + sizeOfParty + ' people will cost you ' + averageCost

3- Vid Syntax Rules
var keyword is optional but recommended to use.
; are optional but recommended to use.


4- Vid Check Plz
https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_argv
The process.argv property returns an array containing the command line arguments passed when the Node.js process was launched.

5- Vid I Declare
Best practice to declare multiple variables with one var keyword and use this Syntax
var x = 3,
    y = 4;
difference b/w undefined and Reference Error

6- Vid Types
console.log (typeof y)
String, Number, Boolean, Object, Function
Types are important as they determine the output of the operation you're performing e.g
x = 3; z = '4'; y = 5;
x + y = 8 number type (Addition)
x + z = '34' string type (JS assumes you wanted String concatenation)
x * z = 12 number (JS knows String can't be multiplied so it converts both into numbers and do Multiply)
parseInt(z) returns 4 and converts String into Int.

7- Vid Functions
can declare their own variables
can pass parameters
can return values

8- Vid Roll the Dice
Math.random()
Math.floor()
Math.ceil()
Math.round()

9- Vid Definations
use functions to keep your code DRY
use functions to make your code readable
changes how our program executes. e.g function code isn't executed unless we invoke the function

10- Vid Scope
where the variable is available
Local variables are declared inside a function
Global variables are variables not declared inside a function

11- Vid Operators
> < >= <= == != && ||
! operator
it's better to use && operator instaed of nested if's
if (){

}
else if (){

}
else {

}


12- Vid While, do While
do while always executes atleast once
while executes 0 or more time

13- Vid For Loop
for (initialize; test; final expression) {

}

14- Vid Arrays
You can put anything/ type
var things = [1, 2, 3, "pizza"];
for (var i = 0; i < things.length; i++){
    console.log(things[i]);
}

15- Vid Why Objects
Used for organizing the data.
e.g Console, Process,
Object have properties and Functions
Console is the grouping of things that are related to output window
Process is the grouping of things that are related to the Node process executed on the computer.

16- Vid Create your own
var die = {}; this syntax is known as Object Literal

17- Vid Responsibility
this referes to the current object.

18- Vid Splitting Up
require indicates you require another file to execute the code. Require still hides the info of the other file and you can use exports to show content to other files
exports is an object similar to console/progress. you can define any property on this object to save the data you want to require in other files
this is what termed as Encapsulation

19- Setting Up (Testing)
npm install -g nodeunit
type nodeunit to make sure it's working.

. means from the current directory
../ means go up one directory

20- Vid Express JS
Install express via npm install express
Boilerplate
var express = require("express");
var app = express();

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    res.send('Hello World');
});
app.listen(3000);
console.log("Server ready ...");

req.query returns a query string
